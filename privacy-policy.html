        <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
        <p>
          By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply
          to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
          before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app,
          any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed
          to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
          shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
          copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
          related to it, still belong to Health Wizard Company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Health Wizard Company is committed to ensuring that the app is as
          useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
          right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
          time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
          services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
          paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Health Wizard app stores and processes personal data that you have
          provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to
          keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
          that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
          operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
          to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
          security features and it could mean that the Health Wizard app won’t
          work properly or at all.

          You should be aware that there are certain things that Health Wizard
          Company will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app
          will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
          connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider,
          but Health Wizard Company cannot take responsibility for the app not
          working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
          you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
          using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
          including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
          If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
          app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
          from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Health Wizard Company cannot always take
          responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure
          that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you
          can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Health Wizard Company cannot
          accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Health Wizard Company’s responsibility for your use of
          the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
          that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at
          all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
          that we can make it available to you. Health Wizard Company accepts no
          liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
          of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android, iOS &amp; KaiOS – the requirements for the
          system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
          availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download
          the updates if you want to keep using the app. Health Wizard Company
          does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is
          relevant to you and/or works with the Android, iOS &amp; KaiOS version
          that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always
          accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also
          wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
          time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
          otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
          to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and
          (if needed) delete it from your device.
